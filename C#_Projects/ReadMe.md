C# Projects

These are some of the projects I created using C# and .NET framework.

Projects:

*CarInsurance
*ClassesandObjects
*Newsletter App
*PackageExpress
*Student Daily Report

Car Insurance:
This was an MVC app that is like a car insurance website, 
it takes in the customers information and produces a quote based on that data. It has been set so the admins can see all quotes given.

ClassesandObjects:
This is actually a game of TwentyOne, within a "Casino" Console App. This was done by using several different files to keep the code tidy and readable.
It allows the user to play a game of Twenty One with a dealer.

Newsletter App:
This was another MVC app, that is a simple design to get the user to sign up to receive the newsletter.

Package Express:
This was a console app, that was similar to a package delivery service, 
it allows you to put in the weight and dimensions of the package, then it calculates the price of the package.

Student Daily Report:
This was a console app, that requests the users input to questions regarding their study day.
