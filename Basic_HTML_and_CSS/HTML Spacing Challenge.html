       <h1>Kingsbridge</h1>
	     <p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight:bold"> Kingsbridge is a market town in the South Hams district of Devon, England.<br> 
		 The town formed around a bridge which was built in or before the 10th century.<br>
		 Kingsbridge is in fact a combination of two towns, Kingsbridge and Dodbrooke.<br>
		 Dodbrooke was granted its own market in 1257 and had become a borough by 1319.<br>
		 While Dodbrooke was originally considered to be the dominent of the two, Kingsbridge later expanded to include it.<br>
		 The town center retains many 19th and 19th century buildings.<br> The shambles, or market arcade, was rebuilt in 1796 but retains its 16th century granite piers.<br>
		 The former grammer school, now a museum, was founded and built by Thomas Crispin in 1670.</P>
